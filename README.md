# Diagrams
User Inputs
The user selects animal type, height, weight, breakfast type, and emotional stability via a fun, animated UI.
Emotional stability is gauged using a slider (aka "Chaos Level").
Input Handling
JavaScript collects all inputs, validates them, and prepares them for simulation.
Simulated Battle Logic (JavaScript)
A quirky formula combines:
Physical stats (height, weight),
Breakfast power-up value (yes, leftover pizza is OP),
Emotional stability (more unstable = better fighter, obviously),
Animal difficulty multiplier (e.g., cassowaries = boss level).
The output is calculated using predefined values in script.js.
Result Display
A result box displays the estimated number of creatures you could defeat.
Animations and colors change depending on your "performance".
Dark Mode Toggle
User can vibe in light or dark chaos using the toggle button.(<img width="284" height="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fdc9ad6-09f5-4ead-b464-a51206908736" />
